-input: vectors of additive genetic relationships to breeding founders.
-model: Two-tower MLPs followed by multiplicative fusion (probabilistic interpretation - probit-links for tower outputs).
-trained on: aggregate binary outcome (reproductive success/fail).
-output: aggregate reproductive result and sex-specific liabilities.
